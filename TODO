# Main code

- Could think about how best to produce a "prediction" from an SEPP method:
  - Say we want predict the next week.  Is a "point" estimate appropriate, or should we somehow "integrate" over time??



# GUI

- Fix stalling GUI on Windows when loading a complex session.




## Very low priority

- See comments in `run_comparison.py` about memory usage
