# Main code

- Could think about how best to produce a "prediction" from an SEPP method:
  - Say we want predict the next week.  Is a "point" estimate appropriate, or should we somehow "integrate" over time??
  - After a bit of thought, this seems complicated (even e.g. for a time-only Hawkes process).  Which is
     perhaps why other authors haven't addressed it.

- Start work on network based framework.


# GUI

- Awaiting input from colleagues on "evaluation" techniques before I do too much work which
  might not be useful.




## Very low priority

- See comments in `run_comparison.py` about memory usage
